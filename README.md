# Chat Application Based On Client-Server Architecture with TCP Sockets in Python 🌐💻

A **basic implementation** of client-server communication using TCP sockets in Python. This project demonstrates how a server listens for incoming connections and how a client connects to the server to exchange messages.

## 📝 Project Description

This project helps you grasp the fundamentals of:

1. **TCP Socket Communication**: Establishing a connection between client and server.
2. **Client-Server Architecture**: Understanding the basic structure and interaction.
3. **Socket Programming**: Utilizing Python’s `socket` library to manage network communication.

## ⚙️ Features

- **TCP Server**: Listens for incoming connections on a specified port.
- **Client Application**: Connects to the server to send and receive messages.
- **Socket Library**: Uses Python’s built-in `socket` library for communication.
- **Basic Architecture**: Demonstrates the essential concepts of client-server interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **socket** module for network communication.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-server-architecture.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client-server-architecture
    ```

3. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

4. **Run the client**:
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```
    
## 🔍 What I Learned

- Importance of **socket programming** in network communication.
- How to **establish connections** using TCP sockets.
- The role of **ports** and basic **client-server architecture**.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Explore advanced topics like **multi-threading** and **asynchronous communication**.
- Develop a more **robust client-server application** with **error handling** and **security features**.
- Apply this knowledge to real-world **projects and applications**.
